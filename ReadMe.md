# GitHub Best Practices for HMIS
- HMIS already follows a lot of best practices when working with Git and GitHub. Infact, the only team that I've seen to follow this much of best practices and GitHub features consistently.
- HMIS needs improvements on areas such as;
    - [ ] Branching (creating, naming, syncing, merging)
    - [ ] Committing (message, frequency, committing only necessary files, reducing merge commits)
    - [ ] Deploying (managing environments, releasing frequency, respect environment hierarchy)
